      <h1 class="yellow">Shutting down</h1>
      <p>
        After years of running the destiny.report websites, I've decided to shut
        them down. As time has passed, I've found myself playing the game less
        and my interest and motivation in developing the websites has naturally
        faded. Without an interest in the game or using the websites anymore, it
        became difficult to justify the non-trivial storage and hosting costs
        and leaving the sites languish.
      </p>

      <h2>So what now?</h2>

      <p>
        archive.destiny.report has been archived. It will remain up for now but
        will no longer receive updates or list new versions on the site. A few
        versions have been skipped due to file size limitations, and all the
        modified JSON diffs have not been archived and so will 404.
      </p>

      <p>
        For developers, the archived raw JSON and SQLite definitions files are
        available to download from the S3 bucket
        <code>destiny-definitions</code> via Requster Pays. See
        <a href="/definitions">this page</a> for more details.
      </p>

      <p>
        The destiny.report discord and notifications will stay around for now,
        but some things may not work if they relied on the webiste continuing to
        update.
      </p>

      <p>
        dialogue.destiny.report has been taken down. Because of the size and
        intellectual property concerns, I won't be offering an archive of the
        dialogue.
      </p>

      <h2>What about Data Explorer?</h2>

      <p>
        My most used Destiny website is the Destiny Data Explorer developer
        tool. As it doesn't actually cost me anything, I'm not shutting it down,
        but it has been living on borrowed time for a while now, getting slower
        and slower with each major Destiny content update. I've
        <a href="https://destiny-data-explorer-ng.netlify.app"
          >had a few attempts</a
        >
        at rewriting it to make it faster, but I never found the motivation to
        make much progress.
      </p>

      <p>
        The site will stay as is (slow, buggy, unmaintained) for now, but is
        ripe for someone to build something better.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <p>
        I'm really proud of all these projects that I've made and whatever
        impact they've had. Building them was not only a fun challenge but also
        a deeply rewarding experience. I credit these with changing my life in
        pretty significant ways - It helped me get a visa to stay in the UK, and
        talking about the architecture of archive.destiny.report played a big
        part of me landing my job at Grafana.
      </p>

      <p>
        Perhaps one day I'll find the juice to revisit these projects. We'll
        see.
