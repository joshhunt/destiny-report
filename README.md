# [destiny.report](https://destiny.report)

This project is the destiny.report frontend, built using React, Typescript, CSS Modules, etc.

## Quick start

```
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```

Installs dependencies and runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Available Scripts

This was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), so in the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
